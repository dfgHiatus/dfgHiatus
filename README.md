### Hi there 👋

My name is dfgHiatus and I develop mods, plugins, and content for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) and [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/)!

A little about me:
- I've been following the VR scene for 6-ish years now, I'm currently researching the impact eye and face tracking technologies have in Social VR environments 👀👄 
- It's my goal to make VR more accessible by designing more natural means of interaction.
- By supporting me, I'll have more time to work on new mods and functionality!

Oh! And:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Varjo Eye Tracking Integration for NeosVR
- 📫 How to reach me: dfgHiatus#7426 on discord

- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that cashews come from a fruit?
