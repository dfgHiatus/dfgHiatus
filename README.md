### Hi there 👋

My name is dfgHiatus and I develop mods, plugins and content for [NeosVR](https://neos.com/)!

A little about me:
- I'm studying computer science and mathematics 💻 📝 
- I've been following the VR scene for 6-ish years now, I'm currently researching the impact eye and face tracking technologies have in Social VR environments 👀👄 
- By supporting me, I'll have more time to work on new mods and functionality!

Oh! And:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Varjo Eye Tracking Integration for NeosVR
- 📫 How to reach me: dfgHiatus#7426 on discord
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that cashews come from a fruit?
